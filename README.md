## Project Overview

This application displays football and basketball match results using data fetched from two sports-related APIs. The UI is designed to be simple, responsive, and visually appealing, with Bootstrap and custom CSS providing the styling. Users can view past results of football matches (e.g., Chelsea) and basketball games (e.g., Golden State Warriors).

## Features

- Displays football match results, including team names, scores, date, venue, and city.
- Displays basketball game results, including team names, points scored, arena, and city.
- Fetches real-time data from third-party sports APIs.
- Clean and modern UI using Bootstrap and custom CSS.
- Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Bootstrap**: Used for responsive and mobile-first design.
- **Custom CSS**: For additional styling enhancements.
- **API Integration**: Fetches data from the football and basketball APIs.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-week7.git
   cd react-week7
   ```
````

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` file** at the root of the project to store environment variables like API keys. Here's an example of what your `.env` file should look like:

   ```env
   REACT_APP_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

   Replace `your-api-key` with the actual API key from your provider.

## Running the App

1. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the app on `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. The app will automatically reload if you make any changes to the code.

2. **Build the app for production:**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This command bundles the app into static files for production in the `build` folder.

## API Integration

This app integrates with two external APIs for fetching sports results:

- **Football API**: Retrieves football match results for a specific team (e.g., Chelsea).
- **Basketball API**: Retrieves basketball game results for a specific team (e.g., Golden State Warriors).

You need to sign up for access to the APIs and get your API key. Insert this API key into your `.env` file as shown in the **Setup and Installation** section.

## Environment Variables

The application uses the following environment variables:

- **`REACT_APP_API_KEY`**: Your API key for accessing the football and basketball APIs.

Make sure these variables are defined in your `.env` file at the root of your project.

## AI Contributions

AI was used to assist in the following areas of the project:

- **CSS Styling**: Custom styles for the app were generated and refined with the help of AI to ensure a modern, responsive, and user-friendly design.
- **Bootstrap Integration**: AI was also involved in selecting and applying Bootstrap classes to make the app visually appealing and responsive across devices.
